### git2jira
Retrieves information about git branches from jira as long a branches names are jira issue keys. For example names are foo-1234, bar-2001 etc. By default the follwoing fields are retrieved: key, summary, status and fixVersions. Key will always be fetches as the first column, but you can pass the other fields as an argument to git2jira/branches-info function. The fields argument should be a clojure map of the form:
```
{ :field_name_keyword fn[fields] (;logic of how to extract the field from fields object in api response) 
  :another_field_name_keyword fn[fields] (;logic of how to extract this field) }
```
Take a look at core.clj field-formatter for an real exmaple.

$ lein run --git-command git_branch_comment --dir git_project_dir --credentials jira_credentails --key jira_project_key --api-url jira_api_url
